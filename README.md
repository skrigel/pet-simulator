# 🐣 Retro Pet Simulator

A nostalgic virtual pet game inspired by classic Tamagotchi devices and 8-bit Game Boy aesthetics!

Take care of your adorable pixel pet by feeding, playing, and letting it rest. Watch its stats carefully - they decay over time just like in the classic virtual pet games of the 90s!

## ✨ Features

- **Pet Mood States**: Your pet changes expression based on how well you care for it
- **Automatic Stat Decay**: Stats decrease over time - keep your pet alive!

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Feed** 🍖 - Increases hunger stat by 20 points
2. **Play** 🎮 - Boosts happiness by 15 points (costs 10 energy)
3. **Sleep** 💤 - Restores 30 energy points over 3 seconds

### Stats Explained
